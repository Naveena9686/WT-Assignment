						<span>The Taj Mahal, one among the seven wonders of the world. Holding a strong place in Indian history, this place is jaw-dropping when viewed in person rather than reading it. Always being fascinated about travelling blogs, once a blog about Taj just popped on my feed. Nothing could stop me from visiting this place after I read it. The next Sunday packed my necessary belongings and stepped out for a solo trip. I took the fast train from Delhi and reached Agra early at 6am. When my eyes fell on this structure, my brain turned blank. I watched the Taj making its way into visitor’s eye through the morning mist. Slowly as the sun rose above, it changed its colour and there it stood the most magnificent man-made creature. It just felt unreal. My eyes couldn’t move anywhere else. All those carvings on it body was the proof of those 20000 workers work for about 22 years.</span>

					<span>The Diana Bench, named because Diana, Princess of Wales was photographed in 1992 is a place where the perfect Taj photo can be captured was said by a local guide. I headed towards there. I spent more than an hour just watching the stunned art. Later I moved on the streets of Taj. Spice shops, leather shops, handicraft shops and plenty of food just completed my whole desires. One can get the best view of it from Agra fort, Mehtab Bagh and the Taj Khema hotel also.</span>

						<strong><span>Mehtab Bagh</span></strong> <span>– This is a Mughal botanical garden complex on the opposite side of the river from the Taj Mahal. It also offers good views of the monument, minus the crowds. The botanical gardens are open from sunrise to sunset. They are perfectly aligned with the famous monument. I took a rowing boat from near and heard that it was the last garden built by the Mughal Empire and Shah Jahan. He built it view the monument from a perfect angle.</span>

						<span>For a day trip, this was mind blowing. Being an Indian, when I was returning from my trip was proud that this great structure was in my motherland. India is famous for art and sculpture is a history telling but this is a proof of the determination that every Indian had while building this, that it stays till now even after years.</span>
